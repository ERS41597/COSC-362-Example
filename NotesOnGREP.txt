What you are looking for in teh documents are regular expressions or
"regex"

* There are two basic Frameworks in grep:
	Basic Mode: Use meta characters such as "?" "+" "{" "|" ( ) they lose
	their special meaning

	Extended Mode: ( Get to with a -E command) you get back these characters
	special meanings.

	You typically type the expression you're looking for in the single quote ' '
	This keeps the shell from interpreting your search too soon or launching grep too quickly.

   
    grep -i ( Case insensitive ) search returns cases where teh different characters are found

    grep -c ( Word Count) counts the number of occurences for a word in a specified document

    grep -w ( Whole Word) returns only lines with the given word and not part of a larger word

    grep -r Lets you do a recursive search through subfolders for the pattern.

    grep -v Allows for an inverted search printing all lines in the file that do not contain the given search.

    grep -L The files without a match command. PRints all files that do not contain the given search expression.

             Example: $ grep -r -L 'Network' /var/log/*

	     print recursively all the files in path that do not contain the
             word 'Network;

   grep -l Prints the files with a match

   grep -A num  Will give context around the match found by printing 'num' lines of context after the match is found.

   grep -B num is num lines of context before

   grep -C num  Will give context before and after  match is found.


   grep -H   Allows you to use standard input via a pipe. Example:

	     $ grep cat somefile | grep -H <expression>

   grep -q Is a quiet mode flag that only returns a 0 indicating a match or 1 indicating no match found.
